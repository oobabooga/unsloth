"""setup.sh / setup.ps1 must not skip the dependency pass on a half-built venv.

Both short-circuit all dependency work when the installed unsloth version equals
PyPI's latest, which is true on an interrupted install: unsloth goes in early and
studio.txt never finishes. So update, and the desktop Repair button behind it,
said "up to date" while the server kept dying on `import structlog`.

That branch only runs for a non-local update, which reinstalls from PyPI and
clobbers the tree under test, so assert the guard structurally instead.
